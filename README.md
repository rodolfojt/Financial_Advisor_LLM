# Financial Advisor

Chatbot built as Financial Advisor using 3-pipeline architecture. My focus on this project is to put in practice some important concepts in Generative AI field such as:
- Deployment of a LLMs
- Designing and building of a RAG
- LLMOps in practice
- Build my first Vector DB
- Build a streaming pipeline
- Learn and use new tools and concepts in practice

This project is a practical exercise based on the course *Learn to Train and Deploy a Real-Time Financial Advisor* .
